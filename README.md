# algorithm-portfolio-20290-thomasreilly1011
A collection of algorithms designed and implemeted in Java as a part of my UCD Computer Science, Algorithms class. Included are some of the most popular algorithms/data structures for sorting, searching and compession. In addition to these algorithms you'll find enhanced versions that allow for either better run time efficiency or better memory efficiency. Finally, you will find a seriers of Benchmark classes that perform an analysis on their respective algorithms. 

## Getting Started & Pre Requisites
To compile or run any of the files in this repository you will need a Java SDK and JRE of 8 or above.
To simply run the provided demo jar you will only need JRE 8 or above. 

To run the main class you must clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithm-portfolio-20290-thomasreilly1011.git
```


## File Strucure
As you can see, the source files are sorted into packages wich represent the type of algorithm and the lab session in which they were studied. Each package has atleast one runnable class, in most cases this is a Benchmark class which compares the various algorithms in the package.
