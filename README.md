# algorithm-portfolio-20290-thomasreilly1011
A collection of algorithms designed and implemented in Java as a part of my UCD Computer Science, Algorithms class. Included are some of the most popular algorithms/data structures for sorting, searching and compression. In addition to these algorithms you'll find enhanced versions that allow for either better run time efficiency or better memory efficiency. Finally, you will find a series of Benchmark classes that perform an analysis on their respective algorithms. 

## Getting Started & Pre Requisites
To compile or run any of the files in this repository you will need a Java SDK and JRE of 8 or above.
To simply run the provided demo jar you will only need JRE 8 or above. 

To get started, clone the repository to you desired location.
```
git clone https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithm-portfolio-20290-thomasreilly1011.git
```
To simply just run a demonstration of tests on the algorithm, a jar file is available.
 ```
 java -jar demo.jar
 ```
If you wish to run and adjust tests specific tests I would suggest opening the source files in your favourite IDE, searching for the Benchmark classes, adjusting, compiling and running the tests from there.

## File Structure
As you can see, the source files are organised into packages which represent the type of algorithm, and the lab session in which they were studied. Each package has at least one runnable class, in most cases this is a Benchmark class which compares the various algorithms in the package.
